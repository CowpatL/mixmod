    abstract={Mixmod is a well-established software package for fitting mixture models of multivariate Gaussian or multinomial probability distribution functions to a given dataset with either a clustering, a density estimation or a discriminant analysis purpose. The Rmixmod S4 package provides an interface from the R statistical computing environment to the C++ core library of Mixmod (mixmodLib). In this article, we give an overview of the model-based clustering and classification methods implemented, and we show how the R package Rmixmod can be used for clustering and discriminant analysis.},
